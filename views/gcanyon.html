				<div class="row row-fluid">
					<p>For the 2012 expedition, the gang chose to supersize our usual weekend jaunt, opting instead check one off our “life list”.  So we headed out west to the Grand Canyon for 5 glorious days backpacking.  This was a much more relaxed pace compared to our usual compressed  2 night / 3 day weekend trips.  Primarily it gave us a chance to explore and hang out without having to rush through each day.  Our chosen route was anchored on the south rim: Hermit Trail down to Tonto Trail, then east along the Tonto platform to South Kaibab, then down to Phantom Ranch, and finally back out via Bright Angel Trail.  Total 43 miles.  Overall it a great introduction to the Grand Canyon, not too difficult, and within the capabilities of any moderately experienced backpacker in good physical condition.   We did the trip in early April 2012, and found the temperature range to be good…a bit hot during the daytime, but cooled off pleasantly at night.  We saw one patch of ice in the shadows near the rim on the Bright Angel Trail, illustrating the big difference between rim and canyon temps that makes for a relatively small window of “optimal” times of the year for hiking the canyon.  None of us are fans of hot weather camping, so we felt like anything later than early May would be insufferably hot in the canyon where there is practically no shade.  Another bonus to spring timing is that winter snow melt feeds the creeks and springs, reducing the need to haul water.   </p>
  <p>Our group of six converged on Phoenix airport midday.  We had decided to fly into PHX and drive, rather than make airline connections to Flagstaff and run the risk of missed connections and lost gear.  We rented a big ole’ SUV for our group of six and made the ~4.5 hr drive to Grand Canyon Village on the south rim.  Our first glimpse of the canyon was truly jaw dropping… more “3D” that can be imagined from looking at a photo or video.  We checked out the Yavapai Geology museum which had some exhibits on the geological history of the canyon—a nice teaser for the hike.  Afterwards, as the sun was setting, we were treated to a show of shadows and colors on the canyon walls.  The surprising element was the sheer depth of the canyon and immense size.  From the rim, we could see straight down to the Bright Angel trail and spur to Lookout Point.  Here’s Rob and JohnE cautiously examining sheer drop from Yavapai Point.</p>

  <p>After checking into the Yavapai Lodge we made a beeline for the Bright Angel Lounge for our usual final trip–ahem— “planning”.  This was followed by a pretty good meal at the Bright Angel restaurant (typical park service fare).  The next morning we gorged on the breakfast buffet, and stopped by the outfitter for some last minute purchases.  Seems the 3500 ft drop-off made an impression on everyone that trekking poles would be a good idea for additional stability while navigating the steep trails.  After this, we checked in at the backcountry office to confirm the water was flowing at our campsites (it was), and then hopped a shuttle at the west gate near the Bright Angel trailhead. </p>
  <p>It was a ~40 min bus ride out to Hermit Trail parking lot, with some exceptional views along the way.</p>

  <p>We hit the trail about 12:30 which was moderately wooded at first, but wasn’t long before the switchbacks started and trees opened up to provide nice views of the side canyon that the trail descended into.  You could gauge downward progress by the changing hues of the rocks, although after a couple hours of hiking, it seemed we were not much closer to the Tonto platform than when we had started.  It really is a loooong way down.  The 8 mile / 3700 ft descent was pretty hard on the legs and glutes, especially after a couple hours of nearly-continuous decent.  The big gear “takeaway” from this trip was trekking poles—we were all firmly sold from day one.  On previous trips back east, we routinely would come across AT through-hikers flying up the trail with trekking poles clicking away.  Most of us had never seen fit to mess with them during our short weekend trips, but this time we were glad we gave ‘em a try.  We quickly found the poles came in handy with downhill breaking and stability over the rough surface, and at the end of the trip they helped going uphill with a small boost from the arms to offload the legs and feet.  That little bit of downward pressure made a noticeable difference over a day’s hike.  Since then we all use trekking poles on all our trips. </p>

  <p>Hermit Trail going down was pretty rugged, especially compared to the wide and smooth Bright Angel and South Kaibab trails that we would take out of the canyon.  We enjoyed the more primitive experience on the Hermit Trail compared to these other thoroughfares.  Although there were several sections with exposed ledges, none of us found it to be white knuckle material, but you do need to pay attention to what you’re doing even while getting blown away by the sights.  Hermit Trail started in a side canyon carved by Hermit Creek, but as the trail worked its way out towards the main section of the canyon, the views got more expansive and impressive.  The so-called Cathedral Stairs were the steepest part—you could basically look straight down and see the trail switching back and forth below.  Once at the base and looking back up, you can’t believe there’s a trial coming down the slot in that part of the canyon.  We finally emerged on the Tonto Platform around 6 pm and hiked a short distance to Hermit Camp.  This is situated in a little gorge by the creek, about 50 ft below the main Tonto Platform.  The creek makes the place an oasis.  There were some other groups there, but not overly crowded.  We took the site nearest to the privy and set up our Tarptents and fixed dinner, taking advantage of the flowing water down at the creek.  Afterwards, we watched the stars and satellites come out and talked about the hike down.  After such a deep descent, we all had the same perfectly logical thought--how the hell are we going to get back out :)?  Over the next few days that thought would regularly pop back into consciousness whenever we looked up at the steep cliffs surrounding us.</p>

  <p>Day 2 was the easiest hiking day with only 3.5 miles on the Tonto Trail to our next camp at Monument Creek.  It was mostly level desert hiking along the Tonto platform with occasional views of the Colorado.   The trail descended into the Monument Campsite which is situated in a deep gorge by the creek, and adjacent to a large rock pillar. </p>

  <p>The steep terrain channels runoff and springs into the gorge area, providing a thick growth of trees and bushes.  This is one of the larger backcountry campsites in the Grand Canyon.  There were several groups camping here, but the sites were spread apart far enough that it didn’t seem crowded.  After setting up camp, we followed the creek downstream as it disappeared underground and reappeared several times.  During times of heavy flow, the water has eroded the hard granite into amazing flow patterns. We scrambled down this for a ~1/2 mile until emerging into a wide rocky river bed (mostly dry) and followed this another mile down a side canyon to the Colorado. </p>

  <p>At Granite Rapids the Colorado is a churning caldron of brown water.  We found a beach area in the quiet back waters just above the rapids and took a quick swim followed by lunch.  I say “quick” because the water was bone-numbing cold.  This day was one of the highlights of the trip—easy hiking, fun rock scrambling, and seeing the famed Colorado River up close.  Back up at camp that evening we dined, then climbed onto a stone ledge above our campsite to check out the side canyon geology in the fading twilight and enjoying a few adult beverages “on the rocks”.</p>

  <p>On Day 3 we climbed the steep trail up and out of Monument Canyon and back onto the Tonto platform.  Then it was a fairly level 8.5 mile hike heading east and winding around several massive buttes.  No trees here—it was pure desert experience with scrub brush, brown and olive sand, and continuous 360 deg jaw-dropping views.  The trail passed close by the Colorado once or twice, with steep 1000 ft+ drop-offs of black bedrock carved by the river.  The trail snaked around several side canyons with attention-getting sheer cliffs as well.  Along the way Pete blew out one of the soles in his boot.  That could have been a serious problem, but duct tape saved the day (is there anything it can’t do?). </p>

  <p>By mid-afternoon we arrived at the Horn Creek camp which was situated at the mouth of a side canyon formed by a small drainage.  This was our favorite camp of the trip.  It was only big enough for one group (3 tents max) and had an authentic backcountry vibe—no crowds or signs of civilization anywhere (other than the “open cockpit” solar privy).  This was the only dry camp on our itinerary.  A nearby inactive uranium mine made the creek water unsafe to drink, as a sign at the campsite made abundantly clear: “Danger Radioactive Water -- do not drink unless DEATH by DEHYDRATION is the only alternative”.   Some choice!  The water didn’t seem to bother the numerous frogs in the creek; they croaked their songs as the sun went down and, no, they didn’t glow in the dark.  We had a fine meal on a boulder in the camp and again enjoyed the stars, satellites, and music over our iPhone speakers.  This was our first experience with dry camping and we found 1 gal water each was plenty to cover ~24 hrs of hiking and cooking.  In addition to the usual freeze-dried fare, on our trips we try to mix things up with some “legit” meals.  A favorite of this trip was Uncle Ben’s red beans and rice, with sliced summer sausage and Tabasco sauce.</p>

  <p>Our rapidly depleting water supplies provided more than adequate motivation to get moving early on Day 4.  We hiked about 3 level miles on the Tonto Trail, and dropped packs to make the ~1/2 hike out Plateau Point spur trail to a spectacular view of the Colorado.  Then back to Tonto for another ~1 mile down to Indian Gardens campground, which was surprisingly lush waypoint along the Bright Angel Creek Trail.  We topped off our water bottles then split up into two groups for the trip down to Phantom Ranch.  One group went straight down the Bright Angel Trail, and the rest of us continued east along the Tonto Trail for a couple miles to sample the South Kaibab Trail, another thoroughfare coming down from the South Rim and reaching the Colorado near Phantom Ranch.  This trail had dusty rust red soil with endless switchbacks on the steep descent to the river.  After passing through a tunnel we crossed the pedestrian / mule bridge across the Colorado and dropped our packs at Phantom Ranch campground.  The first order of business was a dip in the cold water of the Bright Angel Creek to rinse the past couple day’s dust off.  Then we headed up to meet the rest of the gang that had beaten us there and gone straight to the ranch cantina. </p>
  <div class="text-center"><img src ="http://i.imgur.com/Fewqa28.jpg"></img></div>

  <p>Phantom Ranch is a rustic ranch at the bottom of the Grand Canyon with guest cabins and a restaurant with family style dining.  We feasted that evening on juicy steaks and cold Tecate, all brought in by mule train.  It doesn’t get much better than that on a backpacking trip.  Bucket list item: check!</p>

  <p>The next morning was the big climb up the Bright Angel Trail that we had been “eagerly” anticipating.  9.3 miles. 4500 ft up (gulp).   We left in two groups (early risers and sleeper iners) between 6-7 am with the goal of getting to the top before the sun got the better of us.  By leaving early, we essentially following a constant temp profile as we climbed out of the warming canyon.  It took about 6 hrs, with a short rest at Indian Gardens to top off our water.  The cliffs to be climbed were always front in view as we hiked, and it was hard to believe the trail would go seemingly straight up the canyon (right up the center of the picture below--that's the power of switchbacks!).  With our near-empty packs the going was not too bad, plus it helped that we had all trained pretty hard in the months leading up to the trip.  A couple miles from the top, we started to encounter day hikers, some of whom were woefully unprepared and a couple showing signs of dehydration (whom Pete helped out with water and a Cliff Bar).  They gawked at our appearance and aroma fermented by five days in the backcountry.  One foot after another we made steady progress and reached the top and posed for a triumphant rim-side photo.  </p>

  <p>The Grand Canyon is an upside down hike in a way, since it starts off “easy” with the downhill hike, then ends with a big climb, as opposed to mountain hiking where it’s just the opposite.  Down in the canyon the views are somewhat “boxed in” but the colors of the walls and sheer height are just amazing and most areas the canyon is very wide so it’s not claustrophobic at all.  The terrain is so ancient looking that it wouldn’t have surprised me at all to see a dinosaur come lumbering around the corner.   And the giant condors soaring on thermals along the cliffs could easily be mistaken for pterodactyls.  Besides the condors we didn’t see a ton of wildlife.  No snakes (for which there were no complaints) but some of the gang did see a roadrunner. Getting there takes some effort, not only the flying and driving, but also the permitting process.  We planned three different 5-day ternaries, and submitted those at midnight of the first day of the month four months in advance of the month of our trip.  You pretty much have to do this to have any chance of getting a permit during popular times of the year. Fortunately we got our first choice and were very happy with that route, but there are probably no bad hikes in the Grand Canyon.  We did encounter a ranger in the backcountry that checked our permit, so I wouldn’t recommend trying to cheat the system. The Grand Canyon should be mandatory on any serious hiker’s bucket list.   The best part was definitely the scenery; the vistas are continuous so there's no waiting for a break in the trees for a rock outcropping in order to catch a view.  Literally every moment you’re there you are surrounded by postcard views.  Overall it was an amazing experience that exceeded all our expectations.</p>
